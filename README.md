# DGFEM for dynamic viscoelasticity of a power-law model

We solve a dynamic linear viscoelasticity problem of a power-law model.
The governing equation is a vector-valued 'hyperbolic'-type evolution equation involving fractional order time derivative/integral.
In this numerical simulation, we employ the *symmetric interior penalty Galerkin method* (SIPG) and the *Crank-Nicolson scheme* for spatial and temporal discretizations, respectively.
Furthermore, we utilize the *linear interpolation technique* to manage weak singularity in fractional integration.

We refer to our manuscript for more details of theoretical analysis and numerical experiments.
